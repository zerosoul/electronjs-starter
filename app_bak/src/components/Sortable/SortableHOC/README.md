# (Simplified) React Sortable HOC

Code copied from [React Sortable HOC](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc).

The reason for not using the package directly is that it depends on deprecated React APIs - refs and context. I tried to migrate the code in my fork of it. However, my code was breaking some legacy implementations. So I just copied the code and removed all features, I didn't need.

All credit for smart things in the library goas to [Claud√©ric Demers](https://github.com/clauderic) who wrote  [React Sortable HOC](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc).
